                                        These brochures are used quite seldom because they are a little expensive than the traditional brochure graphic designs. 
                                        Hence, they are mostly printed for high-end marketing purposes. 
                                        The inward fold of this brochure makes it compact and easy to carry around. 
                                        The brochure’s eight-panel structure provides more space for graphic designs,
                                        illustrations, information, and images of the product or service of your brand in detail.

                                        This is the most commonly used brochure type among companies. 
                                        A bi-folded brochure is created by folding the brochure into two equal halves. 
                                        In this fold, the brochure has four panels to display information- the front cover, 
                                        back cover along with two internal panels. 
                                        This brochure is easy to hold like a book and skim through information. 
                                        A booklet is an advanced version of the bi-fold brochure where there are multiple 
                                        pages added to the brochure making it appear more like a mini magazine. 
                                        This kind of brochure is excellent for companies that want to advertise multiple products. 
                                        It can also be used as restaurant menus.

                                        This brochure is exactly what the name suggests. 
                                        It consists of three folded panels that provide enough space to display information. 
                                        It can be folded in many ways to optimize its functionality. 
                                        Horizontal folds for wider but shorter panels. 
                                        Vertical folds for narrower but taller panels. 
                                        Such folds make the 6-panelled brochure a compact one, 
                                        making it easier to read it and carry along.

                                        This brochure is folded into a distinct zigzag ‘Z’ shape. 
                                        The Z-fold brochure is commonly used when the information is image-heavy. 
                                        The brochure has six panels in total giving plenty of room to display image-centric graphic designs that can spill-over from one panel to the other. 
                                        This brochure is best used for large graphs, maps, food menus, product details, or any image-heavy design. 
                                        The more advanced version of this brochure with more zigzag folds is called an accordion fold brochure.

                                        Handbills are similar to leaflets but with very little text printed on them. 
                                        They are printed on ordinary paper, ideal for mass distribution along with newspapers. 
                                        The purpose of handbills is mainly awareness. 
                                        It can be for an upcoming sale in a brand shop, a new movie release, a discount coupon,

                                        A poster is a flyer printed with graphic designs that display information, infographics, images, etc. 
                                        The poster is specifically designed to be attached to a wall or on any vertical surface. 
                                        Posters need to have captivating graphic designs for passers-by to receive the information with just a glance. 
                                        Posters are frequently used as advertisements or promotions for events, concerts, films, etc.

                                        Pamphlets or leaflets are loose sheets that are preferred for mass distribution.
